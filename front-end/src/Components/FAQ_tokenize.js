              With Real Chain World, we build an ecosystem that has been ruled
              with the competent financial market regulators. Also, we are in
              the process of becoming a member of a self-regulating organization
              (SRO). To put it simply; we take regulation seriously. This means
              at all times we have to know who our customers (investors /
              sellers) are and therefore we ask you to, during sign-up, go
              through our AML and KYC Process. Depending on the amount you want
              to invest this identification will be by taken some photos. Once
              you're done, you're ready to invest. Only in certain cases we
              might contact you and ask for additional information, this is
              usually the case when your descriptions for the source of funds
              are not clear enough.
