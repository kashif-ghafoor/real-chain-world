# Property Tokenizer
Your real estate liquidation portal
## What do we do
 Property Tokenizer solution is a platform that leverages Blockchain technology, to enable real estate owners to split their property to several shares/tokens and liquidate some of these shares, without having to lose ownership over the whole asset. On the other side of the deal, are people interested in investing in real estate, but donâ€™t have enough money to buy an entire property, or investors who want to diversify their investment to several properties.


## How to use the platform 
Our process is simple:
 1. Real estate authority deploys a property factory contract,
 2. through which owners can create and deploy a property contract, which represent the property to be tokenized.
 3. When property is listed buyers can buy shares.
 4. The source of revenue (rent), which to be paid using the platform.
 5. Revenue will be distributed among shareholders.
